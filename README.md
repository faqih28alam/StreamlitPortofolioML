# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Portfolio

This is my interactive **Machine Learning portfolio** built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io). It showcases different ML projects, including **Heart Disease Prediction** using a Decision Tree Classifier.  

To run Streamlit we need:
Procfile, requirements.txt, runtime.txt, setup.sh

app.py -> code for the streamlit
the rest is material of ML source


## ðŸš€ Features
- **Heart Disease Prediction App**  
  Predicts whether a person has heart disease based on health parameters.  
- **Dashboard** for supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning (work in progress).  
- **Contact Page** with links to my GitHub and LinkedIn.
